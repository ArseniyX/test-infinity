This is an example I put together to try to get Material UI to work with React Table and React
Window with Infinite Scrolling.

I'm not sure when you'd ever want to have an infinite scrolling data table, but it's possible!

I spent a few days trying to figure this all out, so I'm going to leave it up for future reference
and hopefully to help somebody else out.
